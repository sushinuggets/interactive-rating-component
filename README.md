## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was my first solo build from design. I was given design images, a style guide, and some copy. I had a lot of fun creating this component from scratch. This project really targeted my skills with CSS and I learned hot to create my own color gradient during the process.

```css
section: {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    180deg,
    rgba(37, 45, 55, 0.793),
    rgba(37, 45, 55, 0.449)
  );
}
```

### Continued development

I am still working on creating responsive websites. As I develop this skill, I will be making this project a resposive design as well.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow Resource](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57878224/how-to-allow-only-one-element-with-a-specific-class) - This was very helpful in finding the best way to have only one item "selected" at a time withouit using radio buttons. Removing the class from every element before adding the new class.
